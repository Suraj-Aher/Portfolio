                                    this, I understood
                                    the importance of clarity and accessibility in creating designs that cater to
                                    diverse users.</p>

                                <h4>Collaboration with Development Teams:</h4>
                                <p>Observed and learned from interactions between design and development teams,
                                    understanding how to align
                                    design ideas with technical implementation. This experience gave me a better
                                    perspective on how to
                                    effectively communicate design intent and address challenges during the development
                                    process.</p>

                                <h4>Design Systems & Style Guides:</h4>
                                <p>earned how design systems and style guides ensure consistency and efficiency across
                                    projects
                                    . By exploring reusable components, standardized color palettes, and typography,
                                    I developed an appreciation for creating cohesive designs that align with branding
                                    and simplify workflows.</p>

                <p>I have gained a solid understanding of computer fundamentals and networking, learning about OSI and
                    TCP/IP models,
                    networking protocols, and IP addressing while exploring tools like Wireshark for troubleshooting. My
                    exploration of computer
                    architecture has deepened my knowledge of CPU components, memory hierarchy, and system optimization
                    techniques.
                    Through operating system concepts, I have learned about process scheduling, memory management, and
                    Unix/Linux commands
                    for system control. Working with C/C++ has helped me develop clean and efficient code, enhancing my
                    problem-solving skills.
                    I have strengthened my understanding of data structures by studying arrays, linked lists, trees, and
                    graphs,
                    and applying algorithms to optimize performance. Object-oriented programming principles like
                    encapsulation and
                    polymorphism have taught me to design modular, scalable systems. I have also explored digital
                    electronics and
                    microprocessors, focusing on logic circuit design, assembly programming, and interfacing. My
                    exposure to Big Data has
                    introduced me to frameworks like Hadoop, real-time data processing, and visualization tools. Lastly,
                    delving into
                    Artificial Intelligence has been insightful, as I’ve worked with machine learning models and ethical
                    considerations,
                    broadening my perspective on its applications.
                    These experiences reflect a journey of continuous learning and growth across various technical
                    domains.</p>
